                    <li><strong>Mystical Muse:</strong> The song "Rhiannon" was inspired by a novel about a Welsh witch, but Stevie later discovered Rhiannon is an actual Welsh goddess, deepening the song's mythical resonance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secret Marriage:</strong> In 1983, she briefly married Kim Anderson, the widower of her best friend Robin, to help him gain custody of their child. The marriage lasted only eight months but was kept private for years.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Health Struggles:</strong> A cocaine addiction led to a life-threatening collapsed lung in 1987. She also underwent vocal cord surgery in the 1990s to remove nodules, risking her iconic voice.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Edge of Seventeen" Origin:</strong> The song’s title came from Tom Petty’s wife, Jane, who pronounced "age of seventeen" with a Southern accent. It was also influenced by John Lennon’s assassination, with the white dove imagery symbolizing peace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dove Tribute:</strong> Stevie releases a white dove during concerts to honor Robin Snyder Anderson, her late best friend, creating a poignant ritual on stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unmade Film with George Harrison:</strong> She was cast in a 1970s rock musical produced by Harrison, but the project collapsed after a disastrous test screening, sparing her from an acting career detour.</li>

                    <li><strong>Architectural Passion:</strong> Stevie designed her Phoenix home, "Castle," featuring a recording studio, library, and witch-themed decor, showcasing her love for Victorian aesthetics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shawl Lore:</strong> Her signature shawls began with a $3 velvet wrap from a San Francisco boutique in 1974, which she wore to feel "protected" on stage, sparking a lifelong collection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Epic Studio Sessions:</strong> The Fleetwood Mac track "Sara" was originally 16 minutes long, later edited down, capturing raw emotion from her relationship with Don Henley.</li>
